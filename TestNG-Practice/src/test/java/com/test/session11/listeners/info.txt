TestNG Listeners 

* you can use listeners to monitor and react to events during the test lifecycle such as 
	test start 
	test success 
	test failure ... etc 
	TestNg listeners allows you to add custom behavior to your test execution 
	
* Listeners enable you to handle specific event during the execution of tests.
	for example - you can log information, capture screen shots on test failure or generate reports after test complete
